# Rhombosweeper
Minesweeper on 3D isohedral solids of rhombic face.

Does not support chording and auto-reveal of open squares across edges. First click
from player is guaranteed to be an open square only if the square is not adjacent to
the edges.

Player should use direction arrows or WASD to control the orientation of the solid.
WASD is recommended since Q and E (for anticlockwise and clockwise rotation) have no
arrow counterpart.

This project was originally developped by me using Dev-C++. If one wishes to build it
into an executable, he may have to add Rhombosweeper.ico into resource.rc and modify
line 141 of main.c.
